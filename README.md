# BlazeItBot
A dumb bot for AWS Lambda and FB Messenger.

# Privacy Policy
I use AWS services via the Facebook Messenger and Broadcast APIs to send you silly messages, customized with your Facebook name.
There is some logging of requests for debugging purposes, but your data is not otherwise collected or procesed, and it isn't used for anything else. The app is provided as is, no warranty and no guarantee is implied or entered into.
